It\u0026rsquo;s also called the Binary number system if you\u0026rsquo;re studying computer science.\nBinary is the basic fundamental if you start learning about computers. How is a computer identical to this binary number? Computers are man-made compute machines, and machines only recognize two conditions: On and Off.\nThese binary numbers represent those two states.\nWhy is it called Base-2 #Because it is based on 2 numbers, so is Octal which is also called Base-8, Hexadecimal is also called Base-16. even the Decimal number that you use everyday is also called Base-10.\nCan we create our own number system? *The answer is yes, we can.\nConversion to Binary (Base-2) #There\u0026rsquo;s no need to explain Decimal because it\u0026rsquo;s the system you use every day. Conversion to Binary involves the modulo operation, which is finding the remainder of the quotient to determine whether each unit gets \\(0\\) or \\(1\\).\nFor example, we will find the binary number of 1:\n$$ 1_{10} = 1_2 $$\nSince 1 is a binary number\n$$ 3_{10} = n_2 $$\nWe only have 2 numbers, 0 and 1, so how do we represent 3 in binary?\nThe formula goes like this:\n$$ 3\\div 2 = 1 $$\nIf divided, the result is \\(1\\), this is called Quotient. Save the quotient for later use.\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t need the quotient to get the binary, we need the Remainder. For that we use modulo.\n$$ 3 \\space{mod}\\space 2 = 1 $$\nWe get the first binary: \\(1\\). But you have to repeat this until the last quotient is zero.\nHow do you do that? The previous quotient must be divided by \\(2\\) continuously until it runs out.\n$$ 3 \\space{mod}\\space 2 = 1 \\qquad{quot.} = 1\\\\ 1 \\space{mod}\\space 2 = 1 \\qquad{quot.} = 0 $$\nThe binary of \\(3_{10}\\) is \\(11_2\\)\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget to record the remainder based on the smallest to largest quotient (from bottom to top).\nMore Examples #$$ 15_{10} = n_2 $$\n$$ 15 \\space{mod}\\space 2 = 1 \\qquad{quot.} = 7\\\\ 7 \\space{mod}\\space 2 = 1 \\qquad{quot.} = 3\\\\ 3 \\space{mod}\\space 2 = 1 \\qquad{quot.} = 1\\\\ 1 \\space{mod}\\space 2 = 1 \\qquad{quot.} = 0\\\\ $$\n$$ 15_{10} = 1111_2 $$\nAnother one:\n$$ 22_{10} = n_2 $$\n$$ 22 \\space{mod}\\space 2 = 0 \\qquad{quot.} = 11\\\\ 11 \\space{mod}\\space 2 = 1 \\qquad{quot.} = 5\\\\ 5 \\space{mod}\\space 2 = 1 \\qquad{quot.} = 2\\\\ 2 \\space{mod}\\space 2 = 0 \\qquad{quot.} = 1\\\\ 1 \\space{mod}\\space 2 = 1 \\qquad{quot.} = 0\\\\ $$\n$$ 22_{10} = 10110_2 $$\nCan we create ourselves a number system? #\rYes.\n","date":"6 April 2024","permalink":"/en/posts/06-04-2024-binary-number/","section":"Posts","summary":"Base-2 is a number system based on two numbers, 0 and 1.","title":"Base-2"},{"content":"\rAfter learning about Binary System, you might be wondering how to create your own number system.\nHere we will create a 5-digit number system, Base-5.

The key word is \u0026ldquo;master\u0026rdquo;: Private ownership is born out of scarcity in (not limited to) innovation.\nDisruption: Answering How Inequality Forms (kinda) #Private ownership already answers the reason why inequality is formed, but there is also something equally important: Ego. Ego and private ownership are connected by very thick thread, these two intertwined things creates: Competition and Exploitation.\nCompetition for something inevitably results in a gap between the participants. In this context, Innovation and Capital are the fuel to climb the ladder of competition.\nExploitation is the culmination of this problem. A greedy and selfish person only cares about himself, dominating the market as much as possible by pushing down competitors until they fall or using their legs to help him climb the competition ladder.\n","date":"25 February 2024","permalink":"/en/posts/25-02-2024-terbentuknya-ketimpangan/","section":"Posts","summary":"Surplus: Excess of Something #Inequality occurs because there is a surplus in the necessities.","title":"Sociologist Note: The Creation of Inequality"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/sociology/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Sociology"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/teknologi/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Teknologi"},{"content":"The Chalcolithic(5000SM - 3000SM) was a transitional period between the Neolithic and the Bronze Age.\nThe name itself is derived from the combination of chalco Greek for copper and lithic meaning stone. Describing that this era humans also still acquired stones in addition to their copper tools.\nWhy copper is an option #\rCopper (Cu)\rThe strongest assumption as to why humans chose copper over others is that copper is more readily available on the surface and copper is also easier to mold and recycle into other forms.\nBut it should be noted that before the widespread use of copper, humans had also experimented with lead (Pb) with the discovery of lead flakes dating back to the Halaf period, located at Yarim Tepe.\nThe spread of copper smelting #Many archaeological finds of smelters are found around the Balkans at Butmir, Vinča, Varna, Karanovo, and Hamangia. earliest evidence of smelting found in Serbia, in the region of Majdanpek, Jarmovac, and Pločnik.\nIn the Middle East, the documented discovery is at Tell Maghzaliyah in the Nineveh region of Iraq.\nHype about copper tools and their social effects #In this short period, there were no significant developments other than the acquisition of copper (although the discovery of copper was significant). Social life was not as drastically different as before.\nCopperware\rIt\u0026rsquo;s just that the tools that were made had begun to take shape very clearly and aesthetically functionally. Humans made copper as the head of the tool and stone or wood as the handle of the tool.\nSocial stratification began to be complex and developed, for example, the culture of the Ubaid period which later developed as the population increased, became the Uruk period and eventually become the first complex civilization, the Sumerian Civilization.\nChalcolithic settlements\rThis complexity was also influenced by various factors, one of which was that new technologies such as copper increased the demand for new, related and more specialized occupations.\nWhat effect did the use of copper have on mankind #Humans are curious creatures, and their curiosity about copper led to the discovery of bronze. Bronze is a combination of tin and copper that they discovered unexpectedly. This gave birth to the bronze age and will continue to create new innovations with similar patterns.\n","date":"20 February 2024","permalink":"/en/posts/20-02-2024-peradaban-5-chalcolithic/","section":"Posts","summary":"The Chalcolithic(5000SM - 3000SM) was a transitional period between the Neolithic and the Bronze Age.","title":"Civilization #5: Copper as a turning point in mankind's technological progress"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/civilizations/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Civilizations"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/history/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"History"},{"content":"You must have often encountered someone, if you help him find a solution to get out of poverty, he will find many reasons that he can\u0026rsquo;t do it.\nThe people mentioned are 100% sure you have encountered in a lower economic situation.

The other 10% is related to cognitive things like critical thinking, logic, and decision-making.\nHow this inferior mentality can happen #Environment and education play a big role in shaping this inferior mentality.

Therefore, if you have 4 ambitious friends, then you are bound to be ambitious too as long as you are friends with them.\nIn addition to the scope of friendship, parental upbringing is also very influential on this, you may be influenced by the mindset of your parents, besides that the way they educates also affects your character.

But how so?\nGet to know our previous lifestyle #In human evolution, our ancestors have gone through three lifestyle to survive, first scavenger, scavenger namely Homo Habilis, second hunter-gatherer which started from Homo Erectus and the last is the sedentary pattern which started from Homo Sapiens and is still running until now.\nThe transition to farming is the main cause of us hunter-gatherers becoming sedentary. Or better known as the Neolithic Revolution or the first agricultural revolution.\nPrimitive Communism #How come, we used to practice communism without realizing it before farming. To call this communism is actually a bit of an exaggeration, rather we humans actually lived egalitarian lives before the agricultural revolution.\nThe hunter-gatherer culture forced them at that time to live more fairly and share equally the results of the hunt. Gender specialization in the division of tasks was also not too specific at that time.\nEven if there was some kind of commotion, it would happen between individuals or groups that were relatively small. If someone tried to be superior, they would be bullied and ostracized.\nBut why, because the food they got at that time didn\u0026rsquo;t have a surplus and the challenging wild environment, it also made them never think about private property and chose cooperation and egalitarianism as a survival strategy.\nWhen nature is the biggest challenge to survival, why not find friends to fight nature for survival?\nWomen in this era #\rAverage neolithic girl would be dominating if 1v1 with modern male\rWomen also take turns foraging for food with men, women are seen as equal to men. Food had to be shared equally with everyone, and it was usually the women who had the right to do this.\nUniquely, relationships at the time were generally monogamous and birth cycles averaged every 4 years compared to the post-revolutionary birth cycles of every 1 year.\nThe Agricultural Revolution brought both blessings and disasters #12,000 years ago or around 10,000 BC, a transition occurred because for the first time in history, humans were able to manipulate the natural resources around them. Agriculture was discovered and became the foundation of human culture and life until now.\nSocio-economic disparities #Agriculture has also shaped the social and cultural structures that we know today, but despite all the progress we\u0026rsquo;ve made, it has also created one of the biggest problems that we have yet to find a solution to: inequality.\nInequality is possible because humans started to recognize the ownership of land and food that had surplus stocks. When crops were in excessive surplus, farmers had to find ways to turn this wealth around. Exchanging their wealth by paying people as warriors to guard the land from threats and priests to pray for a successful harvest created new jobs and social structures that didn\u0026rsquo;t exist before.\nWhile farmer A managed to hire a soldier and a priest, there were also two farmers B and C who were less fortunate due to crop disease or drought, and farmer A did not know that farmer D and his 4 wives had more troops and slaves working for him. Surely this is a picture of social and economic inequality that was common at that time and is still relevant today.\nSurplus crops create economy and innovation #As the surplus continued to rotate, new jobs related to farming began to emerge and this created an economic cycle where food and goods were needed as commodities.\nThe farmer needs someone who is good at making pottery for his farming needs, but he doesn\u0026rsquo;t have time to learn how to make pottery, why doesn\u0026rsquo;t he get someone to make pottery for him and pay him with his crops. From here, new jobs were created and the economy was running.\nAs time went by, humans thought of something universal that could be accepted as a medium of exchange other than crops, eventually gold and silver coins became the universal medium of exchange for transactions of goods and services (TL;DR: Money).\nTrading is a job that will continue to be relevant as long as farming still exists\rAs the wheels of this economy continue to turn and create new, more specialized and varied jobs, innovation accelerates. People just need a way to earn money, and money can make anything happen (TL;DR: Capitalism).\nDespite all that, we still haven\u0026rsquo;t solved this one problem, inequality. Dynamics continue to occur and those who are not relevant will continue to be left behind by the changing times due to accelerated innovation. Not to mention the greed that tries to outsmart this dynamic, where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.\nWomen are outmatched by men #Since the existence of farming, women began to lose competitiveness with men in anything. Women seem to be second class citizens throughout history. Where initially women were equal in their work division with men, now women are only limited to being active in jobs that tend to be light and home-based, such as taking care of children and cooking.\nThis lack of competitiveness makes women vulnerable to being \u0026ldquo;commoditized\u0026rdquo; by men, resulting in cultural products such as prostitution, polygamy, harems, patriarchy and so on.\nBlessed virgin mary\rHowever, this does not always go to the extreme as there are cultural products such as religion and law that create a norm to respect women, because boy also come out of her\u0026rsquo;s womb.\nPost-revolutionary human health #After the agricultural revolution, humans are required to keep up with the times with the dynamics of rapid change. However, this certainly has side effects on human health both physically and mentally.\nBlack death was a deadly pandemic that claimed the lives of approximately 50 million people at that time\rThe study found a shrinking of the human physique since the agricultural revolution until now. Before the revolution, hunter-gatherer humans had a wide variety of diets that made the nutrients they absorbed also varied. However, since the advent of agriculture, humans have only relied on one staple, the crops. This led to deficiencies in certain nutrients, leading to new diseases.\nNot to mention talking about pests and domesticated animals that became agents of disease, and also the sanitation at that time was also not good. Overall, the quality of life at that time was very poor. But, by realizing how poor the quality of life they had at that time made them realize that it must be improved and as innovation advances, we get that good quality of life until now.\nHuman mental state # Good times creates weak men.\nOver time, the weak-minded are spoiled by the quality of life created by the strong-minded. This cycle will continue to spin and continue to be experienced by all civilizations.\nSome people are demotivated and lost because they are left behind in keeping up with the dynamics of the times, and there are also those who value their lives and set their goals as high as possible for the sustainability of future generations.\nOne evidence that we often experience this mental and health adaptation is that circadian rhythm, the internal clock in the human brain that regulates when to sleep and wake up, is disrupted by midnight sleep hours due to overtime and setting alarms for the next day, leaving only 3 hours of sleep for you and as a result, emotional disruption and this has the potential to bring new diseases.\nThis circadian rhythm could be the result of our ancestors hundred thousands of years ago eventually made a schedule of sleeping 8 hours at night and hunting during the day.\nHow humans continue to adapt in the future #Humans will continue to look for solutions to the problems they experience, but these solutions will inevitably lead to new problems and will continue to create a complex world.\nWe reap what we sow.\nReferences # https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/dec/05/how-neolithic-farming-sowed-the-seeds-of-modern-inequality-10000-years-ago\nhttps://bigthink.com/culture-religion/what-started-poverty/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTYz4m5AcKY\u0026pp=ygUUYXBlcnR1cmUgYWdyaWN1bHR1cmU%3D\n","date":"12 February 2024","permalink":"/en/posts/12-02-2024-bertani-menciptakan-masalah-yang-relevan/","section":"Posts","summary":"When you work hard for the food you buy at the grocery store, you realize that the food you buy must have come from a farmer.","title":"How farming creates your relevant problem"},{"content":"i have acute math anxiety, pls haallpp\u0026hellip;!!\n","date":null,"permalink":"/en/mathematics/","section":"Math Notes","summary":"i have acute math anxiety, pls haallpp\u0026hellip;!","title":"Math Notes"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/civilization/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Civilization"},{"content":"The Neolithic is the final period of the entire stone age, also known as the new stone age (νέος, néos, new + λίθος, líthos, stone). This period is famous for its agricultural practices and sedentary settlements.\nThis period occurred in the range of c. 10,000ya - 6000ya or 8000SM - 4000SM if calculated in AD. In the Middle East, this period occurred earlier than regions such as Europe or China with a difference of 2000 years. As a result, there was so called Cradle of Civilization.\nAgricultural Revolution / Neolithic Revolution #It was a gigantic breakthrough in history. Humans managed to engineer natural resources en masse for the first time in history.\nEarly evidence of agriculture actually occurred in the Paleolithic period, even 10,000 years before the agricultural revolution occurred, precisely at the Ohalo II1 site, the coast of Lake Tiberias. They were still dabbling on a small scale.\nThis revolution not only succeeded in engineering food but also created the same lifestyle, sedentary living and social stratification as modern times. There was less variation in diet, clay-tiled houses for each family, and a more specialized division of labor.\nAgriculture dan Domestication of Animals\rThe domestication of animals also occurred simultaneously, because in addition to relying on plants, they also raised cattle, pigs, goats, sheep, poultry. But the first animal resulting from human domestication was dog (Canis lupus familiaris) from wolf (Canis lupus) which has been domesticated since 14,000 BC2.\nLivestyle became sedentary as humans abandoned hunting as a top priority. An example is the settlement at Çatalhöyük.\nÇatalhöyük\rClothes were still made of leather sewn with bone needle fiber thread, but in the middle of the period began to use wool or linen.\nSocial and Culture #In this period, the egalitarian culture began to erode over time and women\u0026rsquo;s competitiveness began to decrease because their focus was once equal to men, now they only took care of children and food in the house.\nSocial inequality is a relevant problem in modern times that first appeared in this period, the cattle and farming culture made families/groups compete with each other for income, and eventually some of them lost their competitiveness.\nTribalism began to dominate, usually a group was led by a figure who was the most charismatic among them.\nTechnologies #\rAncient House\rThis period gave birth to an architectural style that differed from house to house in different regions.\nA significant invention of this period was the grain mill and sickle as tools for farming. Tools and weapons had perfect shapes. Adze and axe were used extensively for construction.\nNext Age #After this age, humans experienced rapid and significant technological growth due to this sedentary culture.

Humans with large brains are slowly transitioning to settlements by making a settlement while still conducting hunter-gatherer activities.\nHumans also upgrade their devices by making them more precise and efficient in use.\nTL;DR: Humans perform gear enhancements and live a semi-nomadic life.\nNew Stone Age (Neolithic) #So far agriculture and animal domestication made a \u0026ldquo;revolution\u0026rdquo; of the former semi-nomadic lifestyle into permanent settlements.\nIn this period, mankind has begun to create more complex social structures that nearly identical to today\u0026rsquo;s social structure such as regional power, state or simple government system.\nExtensive use of clay also represented a significant change to mankind during this period.\nThis period marks the end of the Stone Age before man discovered metal through metallurgy, one of the greatest technological achievements of human civilization leading to the Copper Age. (Chalcolithic).\nAfter the Stone Age #The Chalcolithic (copper age) is a transition period from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age.\nDuring this period, stone tools were still widely used by humans, at the same time also experimenting with copper that eventually found the formula for copper.\nBy mixing lead and copper, human finds copper, that will begin the next era, the copper age.\n","date":"6 January 2024","permalink":"/en/posts/06-01-2024-peradaban-1-batu/","section":"Posts","summary":"Lithos #Paleolithic, Mesolithics and Neoliths are terms that refer to one age, the Stone Age.","title":"Civilizations #1: Stone"},{"content":"The Paleolithic period began from the c. 3mya - c. 10.000mya, marked by the proliferation of ancient humans, the early usage of fire and the use of stones and thin objects as hunting tools.\nSpecies Evolution Brief #Explains the evolution and spread of the ancestral species of Homo Sapiens that began in Africa (c. 3mya).\nHominini, Australophitecus, Homo #Hominini is a tribe consisting of the Hominina and Panina, two sub-tribes that had a variety of species during this period, but to date only three species have survived to this day, namely:\nPan troglodytes / Chimpanzees (Panina) Pan paniscus / Bonobo ( Panina) Homo Sapiens / Human (Hominina) But, we\u0026rsquo;re going to focus on Homo, this genus is the result of the gradual evolution of the genus Australophitecus.\nSeveral species of Australophitecus (c. 3mya) have already shown evidence of the use of stones as hunting tools, but over time they have been extinct and replaced by the evolutionary genus Homo (c. 2mya), including Homo Habilis, Homo Erectus, Homo Heidelbergenesis and other similiar species.\nThe Spread and Evolution of Homo #This species of Homo spread from the continent of Africa to the world driven by resource factors and survived, Homo Erectus was a species that pioneered in expansion outside of Africa followed by evolution into Homo Heidelbergenesis, then Neanderthals or Homo Neanderthalensis from Europe and Denisovans from Asia.\nEvolution from species to successive species can occur as a result of adaptation to the environment, lifestyle or intersection of predecessor species.\nTL;DR: Because of resource issues, Erectus went out of Africa, evolved into Heidelbergenesis and then evolved to Neanderthals and Denisovans.\nHomo Floresiensis #However, discoveries of Homo Floresiensis in Indonesia indicate that there is a predecessor of Homo Erectus that already emerged from Africa earlier, possibly the species is a precursor or similar to Homo Habilis, of which Homo habilis is the predecesor of the Homo erectus.\nThis discovery of Homo Floresiensis makes the theory of the spread of ancient humans before Homo Erectus a mystery that scientists have yet to solve.\nTL;DR: However, with the discovery of the Floresiensis, we have not yet been able to determine how the migration before the Erectus occurred.\nHomo Sapiens #Among the Homo genus that evolved at that time (c. 2mya - c. 300kya), the species Homo Sapiens (c. 300 - now) was born from the evolution of Homo Heidelbergenesis that exists in Africa.\nBear in mind, that before and after this modern man came, ancient man still existed and they co-existed with these arrivals.\nThis Homo Sapiens began a further wave of expansion out of Africa, establishing a relatively non-hostile relationship with Neanderthals, Denisovans and other ancient humans.\nSub-Paleolithic Period #This Paleolithic period is divided into three alternating sub-periods in order:\nLower Paleolithic #c.3.3mya - c. 300kya, this sub-period is in the epoch geology late pliocene - early pleistocene.\nThe First Homo Appears #Australophitecus are at this time, they tend to be frugivorous (memiliki pola makan buah-buahan).\nEarly appearance of the genus Homo began, the first Homo, Homo Habilis emerged from the evolution of the Australophitecus. Homo habilis are transitioning into carnivorous scavengers through utilizing their primitive stone tools.\nThe reason they become meat-eaters is that the dryer climate changes make the fruits harder to find and the forests start to turn into savannahs.\nStone tools at this time are in the category Oldowan Industry. The function of this tool is usually used to skining or butchering scavenged animals.\nHomo erectus #c. 1.8mya, the evolution of Homo Habilis, [Homo Erectus] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_erectus) appeared and began to spread to the corners of the world. Homo Erectus is more sophisticated in every aspects compared to its predecessor. They were the first species to adopt a nomadic lifestyle, a hunter-gatherer, and have more complex socialization.\nThey\u0026rsquo;re also the first ancient species to make use a fire.\nHomo Erectus also developed their stone tools to be more efficient, i.e. by making them sharper, these stone instruments fall into the Acheulean Industry.\nThe presence of Homo Erectus is a game changer in the history of ancient mankind, sparking fire, making tools plus nomadic settlement gives them access to more mixed nutrients so that they evolve into species with larger brains for future evolution.\nc. 770kya, Homo Erectus evolved into Homo Heidelbergenesis, the ancestor of three species: Homo Sapiens, Homo Neandethalensis and Denisovans.\nMiddle Paleolithic #c. 300kya - c. 50kya, this sub-period is in the epoch geological pleistocene.\nModern humans, Homo Sapiens spread all over the world and made cross marriages between Denisovans and Neanderthals as well. They also exchanged knowledge with each other, like Homo sapiens that accommodated the knowledge of making tools from Neandertals.\nNeanderthals #c. 500kya - c. 30kya, Neanderthals often get the stereotype \u0026ldquo;caveman\u0026rdquo; by popular media, often described as a primitive, low-intelligence and brute.\nIn fact, Neanderthals have evidence that they are a skilled species with stone tools that they make with Levallois techniques, these stone instruments fall into the category Mousterian Industry.\nBesides, some evidence suggests that Neanderthals once performed symbolic rituals.\nTechnology #Significant improvisation has taken place in the manufacture of tools since the Neanderthals invented the Levallois technique, preparing stones of a particular shape before being cut into more specialized tools such as spear-eye, meat-cutting machine or, spear eye.\nTrying tree branches as a handle for the stone tool they make, this will make it easier to use the tool and the tool with a more diverse specialization for future production.\nUsing bones and horns, in addition to rocks, they also use animal bones to make needles, spear eyes, or other tools.\nThe use of plant fiber and animal skins for clothing is also speculated to begin in this time.\nFire and cooking are also common in this period.\nSocial interaction #Homo Sapiens and similar species gradually change their lifestyles to semi-nomads. They live in cave with a group of 10-30 people band that includes one large family or combination of 2-5 other nomadic families.\nThe gender and labor division has begun to emerge nowadays, men dividing their duties into hunters and guards, women taking care of young children and parents in their homes, some women also foraging for plants with children not far from their homes.\nInteraction between species/groups also occurs through proto-language dialogue, knowledge-sharing, coordination or even joint rituals and cultural exchanges.\nOverall, their social lives can also be described as \u0026ldquo;ancient forms of communism\u0026rdquo;, where they live equitably, hunting results are evenly distributed.\nNutrition #The intake of individual nutrients at the time was more dominated by hunting and plants/fruit. They also began to eat fish and shellfish.\nBefore they eat, they cook food on fire first, and they also start keeping meat safe by drying or smoking it for emergencies.\nCannibalism is also common, usually because of food shortages or rituals at the time.\nUpper Paleolithic #c. 50kya - c. 12kya, at this time ice age peak or Last Glacial Maximum occurs.\nIce Age Peak #\rAlthough ice age often refers to Last Glacial Period, but its peak/maximum occurred in the 26kya - 20kya, Earth\u0026rsquo;s sea level at that time decreased drastically, forming land bridge:\nBeringia, in the Bering Strait gives access to the American continent through Alaska.\nSundaland, in the Greater Sunda landmass providing access between Indochina and Indonesia.\nSahul, between Australia and Papua provides access between Australia, and Papua.\nHomo Sapiens Survives #Because of the immune factors of disease, resources, competition and climate, the species of Homo outside the Homo Sapiens like the Neanderthals are extinct.\nTechnology #The remaining human species, Homo Sapiens, continued its journey with technological and cultural advances in the late Paleolithic.\nThe shape of the knife eye, the tip of the spear and other scratch tools undergo improvisation, thinning the thorns and scratching.\nSome coastal settlements have even learned simple navigation and used raft to catch fish.\nCulture #At this time, cultural practices and symbols and beliefs are growing very rapidly.\nThe most commonly found by archaeology is the venus figurine, an engraved figure in the shape of a naked woman. It\u0026rsquo;s not clear what it means and what it\u0026rsquo;s useful for, which scientists clearly assume symbolizes fertility and health.\nCave paintings are also found many times, one of the most famous of which is Lascaux, France.\nThe end of this period #The Paleolithic ended with the transition from nomadic life to settlement with housing made with clay. Late this period archaeology also found some early humans who managed to domesticate animals, making experimental ceramic containers.\nThe settlement and settlement marks the end of the Paleolithic and the beginning of the Neolithical or New Stone Age.\n","date":"6 January 2024","permalink":"/en/posts/06-01-2024-peradaban-2-paleolithic/","section":"Posts","summary":"The Paleolithic period began from the c.","title":"Civilizations #2: Paleolithic"},{"content":"It comes from ancient Greek epistēmē which means \u0026ldquo;knowledge\u0026rdquo;, and the suffix -logi which derives from logos means \u0026ldquo;explain\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;explains about\u0026rdquo;.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Epistemology? #Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that studies the origin, nature, truth, and limitations of knowledge.\nEpistemology tries to answer the question:\nHow and where do we get knowledge?\nHow can we be sure of that knowledge?\nWhich can be considered valid in knowledge?\nHow far is the limit of knowledge?\nIs that knowledge true?\nAnd many others are related to the cause and origin of knowledge itself.\nThe product will be tested for quality by a quality control, then a knowledge will be validated by an epistemologist.\nAspects of Epistemology #A priori and a posteriori #The terms a priori and a posteriori refer to how knowledge is acquired.\nA priori #Knowledge acquired without direct observation or without empirical evidence. This knowledge is deductive, logical and rational, for example, mathematical science, some philosophical principles.\nThe first example is 1+1 = 2 and 2 + 2 = 4, we don\u0026rsquo;t need empirical proof of this calculation to prove the result, just understand the concept of numbers, then we can prove that 1 + 1 = 2, and so on.\nThe second example is the statement \u0026ldquo;all wives are married\u0026rdquo;, no need to ask one by one a man\u0026rsquo;s wife whether she is married or not to prove this statement, to understand the concept of marriage and the wife can already prove the statement.\nA posteriori #Knowledge acquired through direct observation or using the senses (can be seen, touched, felt ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)). This knowledge is inductive, realistic and empirical. Sciences like science, biology, physics and the like fall into this category.\nExamples are knowledge of uranium as nuclear fuel, temperature changes at different altitudes, nuclear fusion and fission and much more.\nBelief #Since everything in a person\u0026rsquo;s mind is always subjective, it can be concluded that the knowledge brought is also not apart from the beliefs adopted by the person. It tries to find out how beliefs are influenced by experience, beliefs, and critical thinking.\nJustification/Reason #The knowledge must also be preserved through reasoning or justification, what makes the knowledge \u0026ldquo;useful\u0026rdquo; or trying to answer the question \u0026ldquo;why do you think so?\u0026rdquo;\nTruth/Truth #All sources and justifications of such knowledge will be validated as true.
