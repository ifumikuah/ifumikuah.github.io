## Surplus: Excess of Something

Inequality occurs because there is a surplus in the necessities. The existence of this surplus is influenced by one of the biggest factors, the manipulation of the necessities themselves.

If we refer to history, the agricultural revolution is the main culprit in this problem of inequality. We managed to manipulate something that is a necessity so that there is a surplus of it, in this case, food (wheat, rice, potatoes, etc.).

Of course, in the beginning, the process of producing or the result of the surplus itself did not match our expectations. This is where capital is born, a capital that encourages us to find ways to make the surplus we produce match our expectations.

## Capital, Innovation and Private Ownership

Surplus is the main fuel for the wheels of capital. With craftsmen creating a sharper sickle in exchange for a surplus of the necessities, we must always innovate. This innovation is what drives the rapid rotation of the wheels of capital.

Everyone will compete to achieve and master these innovations. The key word is "master": Private ownership is born out of scarcity in (not limited to) innovation.

## Disruption: Answering How Inequality Forms (kinda)

Private ownership already answers the reason why inequality is formed, but there is also something equally important: Ego. Ego and private ownership are connected by very thick thread, these two intertwined things creates: Competition and Exploitation.

Competition for something inevitably results in a gap between the participants. In this context, Innovation and Capital are the fuel to climb the ladder of competition.

Exploitation is the culmination of this problem. A greedy and selfish person only cares about himself, dominating the market as much as possible by pushing down competitors until they fall or using their legs to help him climb the competition ladder.
