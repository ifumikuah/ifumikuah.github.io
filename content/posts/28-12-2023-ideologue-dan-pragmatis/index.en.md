In solving problems, there are two approaches used, namely ideologue and pragmatist, both of these are a person's mindset in determining the solution to the problem at hand.

## Ideologue

i·de·o·logue (`ˈīdēəˌlôɡ`) according to oxford dictionary:

> a person whose actions are influenced by belief in a set of principles (= by an ideology) --Oxford Dictionary...

### Behavior

Individuals tend to be fixated with their beliefs, tending to apply their beliefs in everyday life.

This ideologue tends to have a negative connotation, an alternative term for people who are fanatical about their beliefs, always trying to relate everything that happens to their beliefs, refusing to compromise with people who have different understandings from them.

The positive thing about this ideologue is that they are always consistent with their words or thoughts, firm in their traditional values, thus creating and strengthening their identity.

In the worst-case scenario, ideologues in political or religious ideologies tend to be extremists, which is the root of fundamentalism.

A synonym for *ideologue* is *idealist*, a more positive word than the former.

### Example

As a generalization, these ideologues usually (not all) have careers as religious leaders (clerics, imams, apologetics, pastors, rabbis and the like), politicians and motivators.

Extreme political movements such as Zionism, Hindutva, Salafi-jihadism, Christian Identity, Nazi Party, Communism, ISIS/ISIL etc. are products of the collaboration of ideologues themselves.

## Pragmatist

prag-ma-tist (`ˈpræɡ.mə.tɪst`) according to oxford dictionary:

> a person who behaves in a practical and sensible way rather than having fixed ideas or theories --Oxford Dictionary--

### Behavior

A pragmatist tends to see the world factually and as it is, tending to tackle problems in effective and practical ways without being bound by ideological views.

They prefer to compromise and take flexible ways to solve problems, they understand that the world is dynamic and therefore, they have to adapt with the times.

However, the pragmatist often does not think about the consequences or long-term effects of the decisions taken, does not have a very strong identity or principle in him.

The worst impact of this trait is that they will do everything possible to achieve their goals, for example corruption and instant culture, although these two things are more influenced by the environment around the individual, still the environment around the individual must have a culture that tends to be "pragmatic" in dealing with things.

### Example

The younger generation and groups on the left (progressive) side of the political spectrum tend to be pragmatic in dealing with certain issues.

## Which one am I?

You have it both ways, you will definitely use one of the above approaches in various problems you face. You might be "idealistic" if you are given a position, or think of a more "pragmatic" way if you are in an emergency situation.
