Why he has a nature that tends to be like the opposite sex, he tends to be more emotionally sensitive, a thinker, and prefers observation instead of interrupting the conversation.

## Father figure

A father figure is indispensable in shaping a child's strong moral character, a father must teach a child right from wrong based on causal consequences rather than emotional ones.

The lack of a father figure (in terms of role), traumatizes the child. The outcome is twofold: the child tends to neglect his responsibilities or the child becomes highly sensitive to his surroundings. Either or both can happen in this case.

## Closer time with mom than dad

It goes without saying that women tend to view everything based on emotional rather than rational logic. So does the mother, especially when it comes to the child with whom she feels a very strong emotional bond.

A mother definitely does not want to see sadness on her child's face regardless of the context, this gives rise to an emotional-based policy that will be disastrous for the future of the child itself if viewed in terms of causal consequences.

The possible outcomes are three: the child becomes *spoiled*, (spoiled and egocentric), has a rather gentle nature, or becomes a substitute for the father figure in his family.

The third outcome is unique in that it is most likely to occur among widowed mothers or orphaned children.

## Neighborhood treatment

Parents are the most dominant shapers of children's character, in this case parents are also included in the closest actors in the child's environment. Now let's talk about the wider environment, namely close relatives, friends and neighbors.

It is the authority of both parents that allows whether the child will become a soft boy or not. In a sense, the extent to which parents tolerate their children if they see society demanding the child to be a soft boy in the future.

This means that even though the surrounding community is trying to plunge the child, it is still the parents' authority who has the right to their child's future. If they are very tolerant of the treatment, then so will the child be in the future (society's demand to be a soft boy).

## Is it wrong to be a soft boy?

There is nothing wrong with having a very deep emotional nature/intuition like a woman. But further actions such as: dressing the way you shouldn't or habits that you shouldn't, it will make you fall into gender existentialism.

Gender existentialism is the stage where even you yourself are confused about who you really are. The danger of this confusion is already present in western society: Pride culture or known as LGBT, they look very disturbing with their selfishness.

## Conclusion

No father figure is very dangerous. So make sure the role of a father is always there in your family, if not be that proper father for your family.
