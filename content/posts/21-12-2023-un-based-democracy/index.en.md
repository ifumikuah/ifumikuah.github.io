Democracy is a form of government that is oriented to the voice of the people in a country, each individual is directly involved in any decision that will be taken by the country through voting.

TL;DR, In a country that adopts such a form of government, the majority decides what is to do and don't.

The United Nations, as one that upholds the threshold of democracy, states:

> Democracy provides an environment that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms, and in which the freely expressed will of people is exercised [^1]

## Etimology

Democracy or in Greek δημoκρατία `dēmokratía` comes from the combination of the words *demos* (people) and *kratos* (power).

> "power of the people"

### Direct Democracy

The person who participates directly gives his vote without any agency or representation.

This form of democracy is more often done consciously or unconsciously in a smaller scope like a family, a community or even a small organization.

### Representative Democracy

This form which we will discuss in this article, the participating persons are represented by an institution or entity representing their vote, usually a party or similar organization.

This democracy is generally run by state governance entities, large groups or corporations.

## My Opinion

Ignoring the advantages, the author's opinion focuses more on the weaknesses of a democratic system.

### Politican = Citizens

The greatest weakness in a democracy is the people involved by the democracies themselves.

> "government by the people, from the people and for the people"

It reflects that the capacity of a politician in government represents the thinking, mentality or culture of the majority of the people of a country that adheres to this system.

### Money Politics

Corruption and bribery are part of money politics, the activity of self-enrichment and giving/receiving ransom for self-interest is influenced by the mentality and culture of the environment in which a politician is raised.

> "Remember, before you became a leader, you were a commoner before"

## Solution

### Moral education

As the author has repeatedly said, the mindset, mentality, or culture of the individual itself is the greatest weakness of democracy.

Moral education plays an important role in the course of justice in a democracy.

Humanizing a human being is one of the most important forms of moral education in an individual, thus creating a sense of mutual respect among human beings.

Besides, tolerance for being able to share differences is also very important, both of which are very important. One way we can appreciate differences is through dialogue between groups or [interfaith dialogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interfaith_dialogue). 

### Politics education

The political and legal education of every individual can prevent interest groups such as mega-corporates and the like from interfering with the path of clean democracy in the country.

## Conclusion

Although democracy is highly people oriented, it is the people itself that is the greatest problem of democracies.

One of the right ways to tackle this problem is to provide good moral and political education to build a good and peaceful democracy.
